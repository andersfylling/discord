# Contributing

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Disgord.
These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

> **Note:** This CONTRIBUTIONS guideline is heavily inspired by the one created by the [Atom Organization](https://github.com/atom) on GitHub.

## Code of Conduct
Use the GoLang formatter tool. Regarding commenting on REST functionality, do follow the commenting guide, which should include:
 1. The date it was reviewed/created/updated (just write reviewed)
 2. A description of what the endpoint does (copy paste from the discord docs if possible)
 3. The complete endpoint
 4. The rate limiter
 5. optionally, comments. (Comment#1, Comment#2, etc.)

Example (use spaces):
```GoLang
// CreateGuild [POST]       Create a new guild. Returns a guild object on success. Fires a Guild Create
//                          Gateway event.
// Endpoint                 /guilds
// Rate limiter             /guilds
// Discord documentation    https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/resources/guild#create-guild
// Reviewed                 2018-08-16
// Comment                  This endpoint can be used only by bots in less than 10 guilds. Creating channel
//                          categories from this endpoint is not supported.
```

#### Functions and param interfaces
When creating a function, make sure that it has one purpose. It shouldn't hold any hidden functionality, and it could be wise to take dependencies as a parameter:
```GoLang
func CreateGuild(client httd.Poster, params *CreateGuildParams) (ret *Guild, err error) {
    ...
}
```

When you use a dependency as a parameter, either use an existing interface which holds all the methods you require. Or create a new interface for the functions needs (again, keep it purposeful such that other can reuse the interface).

#### Mutex
Struct's that utlises mutex must handle locking in their public methods. However, avoid locking in private methods such that they can be reused. eg. by public methods. The mutex should also be embedded (public accessible), such that developers can lock the object by their own needs.

#### Singletons
I won't accept pull requests where the author has created a singleton structure. I do not want package singletons either, as I'm worried it might cause technical debt. If you disagree you are welcome to create a discussion (not about the pattern, but why your implementation requires a singleton).

## I don't want to read this whole thing I just have a question!!!

## What Should I Know Before I Get Started?

### Introduction

### Design Decisions

#### Handlers
> Also known as listeners/callbacks. The event driven architecture of Disgord is uses the react pattern and as such the listeners can be referred to as handlers.

Disgord gives the option to register multiple handlers per event type. But will not run handlers in parallel. All handlers are run in sequence and that will not change.

```GoLang
Session.On(disgord.EventMessageCreate, func(session disgord.Session, evt *disgord.MessageCreate) {
    // ...
})
```

#### Channels
> An alternative way to listen for events

While handlers are the common approach to handle events, Disgord also support channels. It is important to mark that having multiple observers on one event type channel will cause them to run in parallel (in contrast to handlers). As such it's important to enforce the use of mutexes to avoid issues.

#### Mutex

Every Discord object will hold a read/write mutex. The logic behind this is that Disgord supports the use of channels for handling events, and as such it creates a parallel environment if more than one observers listens to a channel event. Note that the handlers/listeners or callbacks are run in sequential and will never run in parallel, so you should be able to avoid the use of mutexes in handlers.

Also, all the public methods of Discord objects that directly cause a change or a read, will handle locking on their own. But for private method locking is not done(!), such that public methods can reuse private methods without causing deadlocks.

#### Go Generate

If you during your contribution have changed either `events.go` or `event/events.go`, you must run `go generate` in the root folder of the project before pushing.  
This command will ensure that all generated files have been updated accordingly.  
If this command gives you warnings, you must correct them before pushing.

All files written by Go Generate will be suffixed with `_gen.go`, they should **NOT** be edited manually as they will be overwritten by Go Generate.  
Instead, edit the templates in `generate/` or the files they're based on (see previous paragraph). 

### Running Unit Tests
> WARNING! Please do not run the unit tests for the endpoints as these are verified to work before being pushed, and rechecking every time is just spamming the Discord API for useless information.

You can run unit tests without the need of a bot token. However, if you want to properly test all the implementations you need to provide a bot token under the environment variable: "DISGORD_TEST_BOT". Any integration tests depending on this token is skipped whenever it is missing. The following environment variables must exist in order to properly execute a complete integration test (see constant package for information):
 1. DISGORD_TEST_BOT
 2. DISGORD_TEST_GUILD_ADMIN
 3. DISGORD_TEST_GUILD_DEFAULT (must have one custom emoji)
 3. DISGORD_TEST_GUILD_DEFAULT_EMOJI_SNOWFLAKE (snowflake id of emoji)


Editing the event handlers or rest package requires that you test with a bot token to verify success. (Note that tests aren't complete and is considered a work in progress).

> **Note:** The module DisgordWS (dependency) utilises a different environment variable for the bot token, so tests regarding integration testing there are skipped. There should be no need to test the DisgordWS module while developing on the Disgord module.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs
Reporting a bug should help the community improving Disgord. We need you to be specific and give enough information such that it can be reproduced by others. You must use the Bug template which can be found here: [TEMPLATE_BUG.md](TEMPLATE_BUG.md).

### Suggesting Enhancements
We don't currently have a template for this. Provide benchmarks or demonstrations why your suggestion is an improvement or how it can help benefit this project is of great appreciation.
