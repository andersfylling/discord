### Removed
 - Client.SaveToDiscord / Session.SaveToDiscord: The behaviour was too ambigious and introduced just another version of creating/updating structures.
 - Event channels (you now register channels instead, same as handlers)
 
### New
 - You can register channels to receive events (with controller, Ctrl, support)
